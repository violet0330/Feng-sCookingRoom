# Spone Cake
Sponge cakes are often ordered by my friends and online customers, 
the cake body and the sandwich can be freely created and combined to meet different people's needs and my hobby of creating.<br>
Solid sandwiches can be chose between cookie crumbs, different fruits, jellies, etc.<br>
Remove some of the egg yolks from the original cake body and add different coloring to make different colors.<br>
Cream is the same.

## Pictures of partially made cakes
**- Chocolate Cake**
*Chocolate is my personal favorite dessert flavor!*
  Based on the feedback from tasters, chocolate goes very well with coffee, mango, coconut and lemon, and these flavors are recommended to be preferred when trying it.<br>

**- Rainbow Cake**
*My super satisfied creation!*
  Because it is too cumbersome, you need to bake each slice of the cake body in a separate color, in order to cut the results are basically only creamy sandwich, the taste is rather very ordinary, unless a separate order I usually do not do.<br>
  *Adding cream cheese or lemon zest to a creamy sandwich will greatly improve the plain flavor of the shortcomings!*

**- Strawberry Cake**
*The pink coloring of the cake body is accomplished through coloring.*
  Fruit sandwiches and strawberry sauce must be plentiful to bring out the strawberry flavor, unless strawberry flavoring is added.<br>
