# Fillings
Solid sandwiches I usually decide on the basis of personal taste and the requirements of the person who comes to me for a cake, choosing between cookie crumbs, different fruits, jellies, etc.<br>
Remove some of the egg yolks from the original cake body and add different coloring to make different colors.<br>
Cream is the same.

## Chocolate Cream.
