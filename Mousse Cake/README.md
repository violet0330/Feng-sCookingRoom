# Mousse Cake
Mousse cake, is the easiest type of cake in my opinion, 
no whipping or buttercream framing, no baking or mastering your oven, 
the biggest downside is probably the fact that the ingredients are more expensive……

Because of the less sense of accomplishment, I basically don't take pictures.<br>
## Yogurt mousse from a long time ago<br>
Simply replace the fruit puree with plain yogurt.<br>

*Replacing different yogurt can achieve the effect of changing flavors, suitable for lazy people.*
